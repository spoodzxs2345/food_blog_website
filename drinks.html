			<h2 class="description_title_main">Soda</h2>
			<p class="description_body">When it comes to drinks, what most of us will come in mind first is soda. It is refreshing, cold, and very perfect for our tropical weather. A soda usually contains carbonated water, sweetener, and natural and/or artificial flavoring.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="origin1">
			<h2 class="description_title">Origin</h2>
			<p class="description_body">Our story begins in 1767 when a European man named Joseph Priestly figured out how to infuse water with carbon dioxide, creating the first carbonated beverage. Back then people believed carbonated water cured illnesses so "soda" was sold in pharmacies. Pharmacists would mix prescriptions into soda to make it easier for the patients to take.</p>
			<p class="description_body">It wasn't until the creation of root beer in 1876 that soda began to evolve into a drink option. Cola flavored soda entered the market shortly after in 1881. Dr Pepper was created in 1885 and believed to be the first soda as we know it today followed by Coca-Cola one year later.</p>
			<p class="description_body">The story doesn't end there; there have been many modifications to the way soda has been enjoyed between its invention and today. In 1892, Baltimore shop owner William Painter created the crown cork bottle seal to keep carbon dioxide bubbles from escaping the bottle. In 1902, the first vending machines were set up in U.S. providing an easy way for Americans to have access to soda. The state of the soda market dramatically shifted in the 1950s with the creation of the easy-to-open soda can.</p>
			<p class="description_body">The love of soda is still very much alive today seeing that America spends approximately $65 billion in soda a year. So whether you're drinking it from the bottle, mixing it in your whiskey, pouring it over your ice cream, or using it to get rust off your engine, we can all appreciate the contributions made throughout the years to get it into our hands.</p>

			<h2 class="description_title">Nutrients</h2>
			<p class="description_body">Sodas are often high in added sugar and some even contain caffeine. Because they have little nutritive value, sodas have few health benefits, although they can help with hydration. While it may seem refreshing and a welcome treat on a hot or humid day, soda can significantly increase your calorie intake.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="drinks2"></div>
		<div class="drinks_description2">
			<h2 class="description_title_main">Iced Tea</h2>
			<p class="description_body">Another commonly known drink is iced tea. Iced tea is a form of cold tea. Though usually served in a glass with ice, it can refer to any tea that has been chilled or cooled. It may be sweetened with sugar, syrup and/or apple slices.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="origin2">
			<h2 class="description_title">Origin</h2>
			<p class="description_body">The practice of drinking iced tea dates back to the 19th century, which is quite a bit earlier than most popular food histories allege. One of the most commonplace origin stories traces iced tea's invention to the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Richard Blechynden, the commissioner of Indian tea, had set up shop in the India Pavilion to promote the black teas of India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). One sweltering summer day, when few passersby were interested in a cup of hot tea, a desperate Blechynden reportedly decided to pour his tea over ice. In a flash, the story goes, an iconic American beverage was born.</p>

			<h2 class="description_title">Nutrients</h2>
			<p class="description_body">Iced tea is a powerhouse of nutrients and when consumed unsweetened, it keeps your calorie intake under check. A glass of iced tea keeps you fuller for long and keeps hunger pangs at bay. A rich source of manganese, tea can help wounds heal faster and strengthen your bones.</p>

		<div class="drinks_description3">
			<h2 class="description_title_main">Coffee</h2>
			<p class="description_body">A drink that is most common among the millenials and generation-z, coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="origin3">
			<h2 class="description_title">Origin</h2>
			<p class="description_body">No one knows exactly how or when coffee was discovered, though there are many legends about its origin.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="nutrients3">
			<h2 class="description_title">Nutrients</h2>
			<p class="description_body">Coffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), magnesium, potassium, and various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants. Some experts suggest that these and other ingredients in coffee can benefit the human body in various ways.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="drinks4"></div>
		<div class="drinks_description4">
			<h2 class="description_title_main">Milk Tea</h2>
			<p class="description_body">A drink that is popular mostly among young people and young adults, milk tea siply refers to any tea drink with milk added. It can be as simple as a splash of milk in a hot cup of tea, or it can be a complex recipe including various ingredients, like the popular bubble tea. Adding milk mellows and smooths out the flavors of tea, particularly some of the bitter notes found in black tea. Milk tea is enjoyed throughout the world as both a hot and cold beverage.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="origin4">
			<h2 class="description_title">Origin</h2>
			<p class="description_body">Although there are several tea vendors that claim to have been the first to create this now world-famous drink, the most credible is Liu Han-Chieh of Chun Shui Tang Teahouse in Taichung. In the early 80s, he noted that Japanese people enjoyed drinking cold coffee and so he tried out the idea with tea. His cold teas were so popular that his business expanded and he opened several new branches throughout the city.</p>
			<p class="description_body">The bubbles or pearls arrived on the scene in 1988 when during a meeting Liu poured some tapioca balls into his iced teas. Everyone loved it, and so the well-loved drink was born.</p>
			<p class="description_body">Another popular theory is that Tu Tsong-he of the Hanlin Teahouse invented the drink on a whim. He used white tapioca balls which resembled pearls which is allegedly where the name originated.</p>
			<p class="description_body">Wherever it started, there’s no doubt that it took the Taiwanese tea industry by storm and forced many traditional vendors to adapt their menus to include this new and popular drink.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="nutrients4">
			<h2 class="description_title">Nutrients</h2>
			<p class="description_body">As a source of nutrition, tapioca is a nonstarter. Though it is a staple in some native subsistence diets, its only contribution is as a carbohydrate for quick energy. The vitamin and mineral content is very low, and the lack of fiber is so notable that even if you could consume enough tapioca to get some small nutritional benefit, you’d likely become very constipated.</p>
