			<h2 class="description_title_main">Hamburger</h2>
			<p class="description_body">Who doesn't love hamburger? This is, I think, the most iconic comfort food in the world. This food is everywhere. Streets, fast food, restaurants, almost every place sells or makes hamburgers. A hamburger is basically a food consisting of fillings-usually meat and vegetables-placed inside a sliced bun.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="origin1">
			<h2 class="description_title">Origin</h2>
			<p class="description_body">By the 19th century, beef from German Hamburg cows was minced and combined with garlic, onions, salt and pepper, then formed into patties (without bread or a bun) to make Hamburg steaks. These early burgers were considered gourmet and were quite pricey, given the quality of Hamburg beef.</p>
			<p class="description_body">When German immigrants began arriving in New York and Chicago, many earned a living by opening restaurants. Menus frequently featured Hamburg steak, an Americanized version of the German offering. It was often the most expensive dish on the menu. During the Industrial Revolution, factory workers were served Hamburg steak from food carts. They proved difficult to eat while standing, so one creative cook sandwiched the meat patty between two slices of bread (the culinary innovator’s name has sadly been lost to history).</p>
			<p class="description_body">Thus, the Hamburg sandwich was born, an evolution that boosted this food’s popularity all over the country.</p>

				<li>Step 1</li>
				Divide the beef into 2 patties, each about ¾-inch (2 cm) thick and 3 ½ inches (9 cm) in diameter. Transfer the patties to a plate or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

			<p class="description_body">Eating a hamburger will boost your saturated fat intake. Ground beef, the primary ingredient in a burger, is high in saturated fat. And many people prepare their burgers using additional fat like butter or oil.</p>
			<p class="description_body">Saturated fat is linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. The nutrition experts at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommend that you limit your saturated fat intake to 10% of your total daily calorie consumption.</p>
			<p class="description_body">Still, a hamburger does provide some nutritional value. It is a good source of protein, iron, phosphorus, and several other nutrients. If you choose to eat your hamburger on a whole grain bun, it may also provide healthy, filling fiber.</p>

			<p class="description_body">According to Belgian lore, poor villagers living in Meuse Valley would often ate small fried fish they caught in the river. During the winter months when the river froze, fishing would become an impossible task and forced villagers to find other sources of food.</p>
			<p class="description_body">This is when the villagers turned to the root plant, potatoes, slicing and frying them just like the way they prepared fish.</p>

			<h2 class="description_title_main">Tempura</h2>
			<p class="description_body">Anything shrimp or prawn is undeniably delicious. Tempura never fails to prove that. Tempura is a typical Japanese dish usually consisting of seafood, meat, and vegetables that have been battered and deep fried.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="origin3">
			<h2 class="description_title">Origin</h2>
			<p class="description_body">In the 16th century Muromachi period, Portuguese Catholic missionaries to Japan brought with them the Western-style cooking method of coating foods with flour and then frying them. Thus began the history of tempura in Japan. It’s interesting to note that it arrived at the same time as wine, via Japan’s trade with the Western powers of the day and their Asian colonies (collectively referred to as “Namban” in Japan).</p>
			<p class="description_body">Nagasaki tempura derives from Namban cuisine, and first appeared in the late 16th century Azuchi–Momoyama period. Sugar was mixed into the flour, and the ingredients were covered in thick batter containing sake, then fried in lard. As the batter already contained seasoning, the tempura was eaten as-is. This tempura was somewhat similar to Western-style fritters. Today’s Japanese tempura is said to have begun with Nagasaki tempura.</p>
